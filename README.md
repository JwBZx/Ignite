# Ignite :fire::crown::arrow_up:

Welcome to Ignite! :fire::crown::arrow_up::+1:

This is a GitHub Repository where I will place any inspiration (like app, game, software, and website ideas, Bible Verses, message notes, or anything else) that I got from Ignite 2015.

Ignite is a weekend youth camp that is happening this weekend from November 6th-8th!

If I get any inspiration for any projects, good notes from a sermon, or anything else that I feel needs to go in this repository, I will be sure to update this repository and add it!

Thank You for checking out this Repository/Project and God Bless!
