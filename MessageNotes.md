#Message Notes

Welcome to the "Message Notes" file in my Ignite (:fire::crown::arrow_up::+1:) GitHub Repository!

This is the file that will contain all of the Message Notes that I got from Ignite and that I wanted to save and look at in the future!
So that's pretty much the file in a nutshell! See the "Inspiration" and "Bible Verses" files for some more stuff I got out of Ignite!

So now that my introduction is over, here is all of the Message Notes:

Thank You for reading this file, and I hope that you learned something cool from the Message Notes!

Thank You and God Bless!
